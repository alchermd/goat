## Unstructured Notes

- In TDD the first step is always the same: write a test.
- First we write the test; then we run it and check that it fails as expected. Only then do we go ahead and build some 
of our app.
- The `unittest` module provides a nicer interface on writing test cases, a much better upgrade than just using `assert`
statements. A particular advantage is that the `unittest.TestCase` class has the `setUp` and `tearDown` methods that we
can use to execute commands before and after the tests had run.

## Terminologies and Concepts

- Functional Test == Acceptance Test == End-to-End Test
- User Story
    - A description of how the application will work from the point of view of the user. Used to structure a functional test.
- Expected failure
    - When a test fails in the way that we expected it to.
- Functional vs Unit Tests
    - Functional tests test the application from the outside, from the point of view of the user.
    - Functional tests should help you build an application with the right functionality, and guarantee you never 
    accidentally break it. 
    - Unit tests test the application from the inside, from the point of view of the programmer.
    - Unit tests should help you to write code thatâ€™s clean and bug free. 
- The unit-test/code cycle
    1. Run the unit tests in the terminal.
    2. Make a minimal code change in the editor.
    3. Repeat!
